# DropPlayerHead Minecraft Plugin

A lightweight Minecraft Paper plugin that drops player-unique heads on death based on a customizable percentage.

## Installation
- Download the .jar file from the newest release on git

- Fix command auto-complete (tab) suggestions

## Commands (OP Only)
- `/drophead get` — gets the head of a specific player  
- `/drophead set <0-100>` — change the drop % 
- `/drophead reload` — reloads the yml file if it was edited outside of the game commands
